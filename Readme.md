## üè¢ Technical Overview

### Architecture Summary

| Layer      | Technology                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Frontend   | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS         |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express, Mongoose        |
| Database   | MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)      |
| Payments   | PayU (India)                      |
| Email      | Nodemailer + Brevo (SMTP)         |
| Hosting    | AWS                               |
| Security   | JWT, CSRF, 2FA, HTTPS, Rate Limit |

### AI Query Generation
> **How it works:**
> - Users enter requests in plain English (e.g., "Show all orders from last month").
> - The frontend sends this prompt to the backend, which uses an AI model to generate a valid MongoDB query.
> - The query is returned, editable, and executable in the UI.
> - This empowers all users‚Äîregardless of technical skill‚Äîto work with MongoDB efficiently and accurately.

### Security & Compliance
- All data in transit is encrypted (HTTPS).
- JWT authentication, CSRF protection, and 2FA are enforced.
- Rate limiting and CORS are active on all endpoints.
- No database credentials are stored after session ends.
- Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Refund Policy are accessible in-app.
